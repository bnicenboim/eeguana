\description{
\code{adapt_fast_ICA()} and \code{fast_ICA2()} are wrappers for \link[fICA:adapt_fICA]{fICA::adapt_fICA} and \link[fICA:fICA]{fICA::fICA} that only run in C, and return a transposed
version
of the original estimated unmixing matrix in W, and the mixing matrix A,
consistent with the formulation \code{X= S \%*\% A}, where X is the matrix of data with
N_samples by N_channels, and S is a matrix of sources with N_samples by N_sources.
They are meant to be  used with \code{\link[=eeg_ica]{eeg_ica()}}. In order to save memory, these wrappers do not
return the estimated
source components.
